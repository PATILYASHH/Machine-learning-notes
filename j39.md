### Q. Explain any four `Thread` class methods. (4 Marks)

The `Thread` class in Java provides several methods to control and manage threads.  
Four commonly used methods are:

---

#### ✅ 1. `start()`
- Begins the execution of a thread.
- Internally calls the `run()` method.
```java
t.start();


---

✅ 2. run()

Contains the code that will be executed by the thread.

Must be overridden when creating a thread.


public void run() {
    System.out.println("Thread running...");
}


---

✅ 3. sleep(ms)

Pauses the thread for the specified time (in milliseconds).

Used for delaying task execution.


Thread.sleep(1000); // 1 second


---

✅ 4. join()

Allows one thread to wait until another completes execution.


t.join();  // Wait until thread t finishes


---

These methods help in starting, executing, pausing, and synchronizing threads in Java programs.
