### Explain in Detail the Types of Machine Learning – 8 Marks

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning (ML) can be classified into different types based on how the model learns from data and the kind of feedback it receives.  
The main types are **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning**, **Semi-Supervised Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.

---

### **1. Supervised Learning**
- **Definition:**  
  The model is trained using **labeled data**, meaning each input has a known correct output.  
  The system learns the mapping between inputs and outputs to make future predictions.
  
- **Goal:** Predict output values for new unseen inputs.

- **Examples:**  
  - Predicting house prices (Regression)  
  - Email spam detection (Classification)

- **Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**
- **Definition:**  
  The model is trained on **unlabeled data** — no predefined output is given.  
  The system tries to **find hidden patterns or structures** in the data.

- **Goal:** Group or organize data based on similarity.

- **Examples:**  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Market basket analysis  

- **Algorithms:**  
  - K-Means Clustering  
  - Hierarchical Clustering  
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

---

### **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**
- **Definition:**  
  A combination of **supervised and unsupervised learning** where the dataset contains a **small amount of labeled data** and a **large amount of unlabeled data**.
  
- **Goal:** Improve learning accuracy using both labeled and unlabeled data.

- **Example:**  
  - Web content classification  
  - Speech recognition systems  

- **Algorithm Example:**  
  - Self-training models  
  - Graph-based algorithms

---

### **4. Reinforcement Learning**
- **Definition:**  
  The model learns by **interacting with an environment** and receiving **rewards or penalties** based on its actions.
  
- **Goal:** Learn a sequence of actions that maximize total reward over time.

- **Examples:**  
  - Game-playing AI (like Chess or Go)  
  - Robotics and autonomous driving  

- **Algorithms:**  
  - Q-Learning  
  - Deep Q-Network (DQN)

✅ **In short:**  
| Type | Data Used | Goal | Example |
|------|------------|------|----------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Labeled | Predict outcomes | Spam detection |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | Unlabeled | Find patterns | Customer segmentation |
| **Semi-Supervised Learning** | Partly labeled | Improve accuracy | Speech recognition |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Reward-based | Learn actions | Game AI |

**Conclusion:**  
The four types of Machine Learning help systems learn from data in different ways — from direct supervision to self-discovery and trial-and-error — enabling ML to solve a wide range of real-world problems.
