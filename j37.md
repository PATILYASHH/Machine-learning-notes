### Q. Write short note on types of exceptions. (4 Marks)

In Java, exceptions are unexpected events that disrupt the normal program flow.  
They are categorized into two main types:

---

### ✅ 1. **Checked Exceptions**
- Checked at **compile-time**
- Must be handled using `try-catch` or `throws`
- Common for **I/O and database operations**

**Example:** `IOException`, `SQLException`, `ClassNotFoundException`

```java
try {
    FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println(e);
}


---

✅ 2. Unchecked Exceptions

Checked at runtime

Occur due to programming errors (logic mistakes, illegal operations)

Not compulsory to handle


Example: ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException

int a = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException


---

Summary:

Checked exceptions → compile-time, mandatory handling

Unchecked exceptions → runtime errors, not mandatory to handle


These exception types help maintain safe, error-free, and robust programs.
