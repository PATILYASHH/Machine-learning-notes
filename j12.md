### Q. Write short note on static variable and static method in Java. (4 Marks)

In Java, `static` keyword is used to create class-level members that belong to the class rather than individual objects.

---

#### ✅ Static Variable
- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- Shared by all objects of the class (only one copy exists in memory).
- Used to store common data for all objects.

**Example:**
```java
class Demo {
    static int count = 0; // static variable
}


---

✅ Static Method

Declared using the static keyword.

Can be called without creating an object of the class.

Can access only static variables directly.


Example:

class Demo {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static Method");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo.display(); // calling static method
    }
}

Static members are useful for memory efficiency, shared values, and utility functions.
