### Q. What is type casting? Explain implicit and explicit type casting with example. (8 Marks)

Type casting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another. It is used when we need to store a value of one type into a different type variable.

#### ✅ Implicit Type Casting (Widening)
- Done automatically by the compiler.
- Converts **smaller data type → larger data type**.
- No data loss occurs.

**Order:** byte → short → int → long → float → double

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10;
double b = a; // implicit casting
System.out.println(b); // Output: 10.0


---

✅ Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing)

Done manually by the programmer.

Converts larger data type → smaller data type.

May cause data loss.


Example:

double x = 10.75;
int y = (int) x; // explicit casting
System.out.println(y); // Output: 10

Type casting allows smooth data conversion in Java, making it easier to perform calculations and assign values between different data types.
