### Q. Define Thread. How to create a thread by extending Thread class? (8 Marks)

A **Thread** in Java is a lightweight sub-process that allows a program to execute multiple tasks **concurrently**.  
It enables **multitasking**, improves performance, and makes applications more responsive.

### ✅ Creating a Thread by Extending `Thread` Class

To create a thread by extending the `Thread` class:
1. Create a class that extends `Thread`
2. Override the `run()` method (contains thread logic)
3. Create object of the class
4. Call `start()` method to begin execution

---

### ✅ Example

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread(); // create thread object
        t.start();                   // start thread
    }
}


---

✅ Output

Thread is running...


---

This method creates a separate thread of execution.
The run() method defines the task, and start() internally calls run() and begins execution in a new thread.
