### Q. Explain concept of Thread Synchronization. (4 Marks)

Thread synchronization in Java is a mechanism that ensures **only one thread accesses shared resources at a time**.  
It is used to prevent **data inconsistency, race conditions, and unexpected behavior** when multiple threads try to modify shared data simultaneously.

Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to lock a critical section (method or block) so that only one thread can execute it at a time.

### ✅ Example

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method
    synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Counter c = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) c.increment();
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) c.increment();
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + c.count);
    }
}

✅ Output (Expected)

Final Count: 2000

Synchronization ensures safe and consistent execution in multithreaded Java programs by protecting shared data from concurrent access.
