### Q. Write a short note on Type Casting in Java. (4 Marks)

Type casting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another. It is useful when performing operations between different data types or when storing one type of value into another type.

**Types of Type Casting:**

- **Implicit (Widening) Casting:**  
  Done automatically when converting a smaller type to a larger type.  
  Example: `int → long → float → double`

- **Explicit (Narrowing) Casting:**  
  Done manually when converting a larger type to a smaller type.  
  Example: `double → float → long → int → short → byte`  
  Syntax:  
  ```java
  int x = (int) 10.5;
