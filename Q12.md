## Need for Machine Learning and Its Classification (8 Marks)


---

Need for Machine Learning:

Machine Learning (ML) is needed because traditional programming cannot handle large and complex data efficiently.
In the modern world, data is generated at a huge scale — from social media, sensors, phones, and business systems — and ML helps in analyzing, understanding, and making predictions from this data automatically.

Key Reasons Why ML is Needed:

1. Handling Large Amounts of Data:

ML can process and analyze massive data faster than humans.



2. Automation of Tasks:

It helps in automating repetitive and time-consuming work like email sorting or fraud detection.



3. Improved Accuracy:

ML learns from past data to make predictions that get more accurate over time.



4. Decision Making:

It assists in making better decisions using data-driven insights.



5. Pattern Recognition:

ML discovers hidden trends and relationships in data that are difficult to find manually.




✅ In short:
Machine Learning is needed to make computers learn from data, improve automatically, and make intelligent decisions without manual programming.

Classification of Machine Learning:

Machine Learning algorithms are classified into three main types based on how they learn from data.


---

1. Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, which means both input and output are known.

The goal is to learn the mapping from input to output.


Examples:

Predicting house prices based on size and location.

Classifying emails as spam or not spam.


Common Algorithms:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM)



---

2. Unsupervised Learning

The model is trained using unlabeled data — only inputs are given, and the algorithm finds patterns or groups on its own.

It is mainly used for clustering and association.


Examples:

Customer segmentation based on shopping behavior.

Grouping similar images or documents.


Common Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

Apriori Algorithm

3. Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

The goal is to learn the best strategy (policy) to maximize rewards.


Examples:

Game-playing AI like Chess or Go.

Self-driving cars learning to navigate roads.


Common Algorithms:

Q-Learning

Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

✅ In short:
Machine Learning is needed to make systems intelligent and data-driven.
It is classified into:

Supervised Learning (learn from labeled data),

Unsupervised Learning (find hidden patterns), and

Reinforcement Learning (learn from experience and rewards).
