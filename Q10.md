# Function Approximation (4 Marks)

Definition:
Function approximation in Machine Learning means finding a mathematical function that best represents the relationship between input and output data.
It helps the model learn patterns from data so it can predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.


---

Example:
If we have data showing how hours studied affect exam marks,
ML tries to find a function like:

Marks = f(Hours Studied)

This function f is the approximation learned by the model.

Types:

1. Linear Approximation:

Uses a straight-line relationship between input and output.



2. Non-linear Approximation:

Uses curves or complex functions to fit data that’s not in a straight line.

✅ In short:
Function approximation is the process where ML models learn a mapping from input to output, helping them make predictions for new data.
