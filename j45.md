### Q. Define Thread. How to create a thread by implementing Runnable interface? (8 Marks)

A **Thread** in Java is a lightweight process used for **concurrent execution** of tasks.  
It allows a program to perform multiple operations **simultaneously**, improving performance and responsiveness.

### ✅ Creating a Thread by Implementing `Runnable` Interface

To create a thread using `Runnable` interface:
1. Create a class that implements `Runnable`
2. Override the `run()` method (contains task code)
3. Create a `Thread` object and pass the `Runnable` object to it
4. Call `start()` method to begin execution

### ✅ Example

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyTask task = new MyTask();        // Create Runnable object
        Thread t = new Thread(task);       // Pass task to Thread
        t.start();                          // Start thread
    }
}


---

✅ Output

Thread is running...

Using Runnable is preferred when:

The class needs to extend another class

You want to separate thread logic from class logic


This method promotes better design and flexibility in multithreading.
