### What is Data Preprocessing? Why Do We Need It? (4 Marks)

**Definition:**  
Data preprocessing is the **initial step** in a Machine Learning workflow where **raw data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared** before feeding it to a model.  
It helps convert messy or incomplete data into a **structured and meaningful format** suitable for training.

### **Why Do We Need Data Preprocessing?**

1. **Removes Noise and Errors**  
   - Real-world data often contains **irrelevant or incorrect information**.  
   - Preprocessing removes such noise for better learning accuracy.  

2. **Handles Missing Values**  
   - Missing or incomplete data can lead to **wrong model predictions**.  
   - Preprocessing fills or removes missing entries appropriately.  

3. **Ensures Consistency**  
   - Data may come from different sources or formats.  
   - Preprocessing makes it **uniform and consistent** across all samples.  

4. **Improves Model Performance**  
   - Clean and normalized data helps ML algorithms **train faster** and **predict more accurately**.  

5. **Prepares for Feature Scaling**  
   - Normalization or standardization ensures all features are on the **same scale**, improving algorithm performance (especially for distance-based models like KNN or SVM).

✅ **In short:**  
Data preprocessing is **essential to convert raw data into high-quality input**, reducing noise and improving the **accuracy, efficiency, and reliability** of Machine Learning models.
