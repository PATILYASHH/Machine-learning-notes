### How to Treat Data in Machine Learning (4 Marks)

**Definition:**  
Treating data in Machine Learning means **preparing and cleaning raw data** before using it to train a model.  
Good data treatment ensures that the ML algorithm can **learn patterns accurately** and produce **reliable predictions**.

### Steps to Treat Data

#### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Remove **missing, duplicate, or incorrect values**.  
- Handle **null entries** by filling them with mean, median, or removing the row.  

#### **2. Data Integration**
- Combine data from multiple sources into a **single dataset**.  
- Example: Merging data from databases, sensors, or CSV files.  

#### **3. Data Transformation**
- Convert data into a usable form using **normalization or standardization**.  
- Helps keep all features on the same scale (important for algorithms like KNN or SVM).  

#### **4. Data Reduction**
- Reduce the **size or number of features** using methods like **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.  
- Makes training faster and avoids overfitting.  

#### **5. Data Splitting**
- Divide data into **training and testing sets** (example: 80% training, 20% testing).  
- Training data teaches the model, testing data checks its performance.

✅ **In short:**  
Treating data in ML means performing **cleaning, integration, transformation, reduction, and splitting** — ensuring the dataset is **accurate, consistent, and ready** for model training.
