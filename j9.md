### Q. Explain branching statements in Java with example. (8 Marks)

Branching statements in Java are used to **change the normal flow of execution** based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to make decisions and jump to different parts of the code.

Java provides the following branching statements:

---

#### 1. **if–else Statement**
Used to execute block of code based on a condition.

**Example:**
```java
int age = 18;
if(age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
} else {
    System.out.println("Not eligible");
}
// Output: Eligible to vote


---

2. Nested if Statement

An if statement inside another if statement.

Example:

int marks = 85;
if(marks >= 60) {
    if(marks >= 80) {
        System.out.println("Distinction");
    }
}
// Output: Distinction


---

3. switch Statement

Used when multiple conditions need to be checked for the same variable.

Example:

int day = 2;
switch(day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Other Day");
}
// Output: Tuesday

Branching statements help Java programs make decisions and execute different code paths based on conditions.
