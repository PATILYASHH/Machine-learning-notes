    <h2 id="k-nearest-neighbor-knn-algorithm">K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm –</h2>
<p>Definition:
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems.
It predicts the output for a new data point by looking at the ‘K’ nearest data points in the training dataset and choosing the most common class (for classification) or average value (for regression).</p>
<hr>
<p>Working of KNN Algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the number of neighbors (K):</li>
</ol>
<p>Select a suitable value of K (e.g., 3, 5, 7).</p>
<p>K decides how many nearby points will be considered when making a prediction.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the distance:</li>
</ol>
<p>Find the distance between the new data point and all other data points in the training set.</p>
<p>Common distance formulas used are:</p>
<p>Euclidean Distance</p>
<p>d = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the nearest neighbors:</li>
</ol>
<p>Sort all distances and select the K smallest distances (the closest points).</p>
<ol>
<li>Voting or Averaging:</li>
</ol>
<p>For classification: Choose the class that appears most among the K neighbors.</p>
<p>For regression: Take the average of the K nearest values.</p>
<ol>
<li>Predict the result:</li>
</ol>
<p>The selected class or averaged value becomes the model’s prediction.</p>
<hr>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Suppose we want to classify whether a fruit is an apple or orange based on its weight and color.
If K = 3, and among the 3 nearest neighbors,</p>
<p>2 are apples and 1 is orange → the new fruit is predicted as apple.</p>
<hr>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>Simple and easy to implement.</p>
<p>No training phase required (lazy learner).</p>
<p>Works well with small datasets.</p>
<hr>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<p>Slow for large datasets because it compares every point.</p>
<p>Sensitive to noisy data and irrelevant features.</p>
<p>Requires normalization of data for accurate distance calculation.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
KNN is a lazy learning algorithm that classifies or predicts based on similarity (distance) between data points.
It’s simple and effective for small datasets but less efficient for large or high-dimensional data.</p>
