<p>| <strong>Aspect</strong> | <strong>Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)</strong> | <strong>Aggregation</strong> |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| <strong>Definition</strong> | Bagging is a Machine Learning ensemble technique that combines results from <strong>multiple models trained on different bootstrap samples</strong> of the data. | Aggregation is the <strong>process of combining the outputs</strong> of multiple models to produce a <strong>final prediction</strong>. |
| <strong>Data Used</strong> | Uses <strong>bootstrap samples</strong> (sampling with replacement) from the training data. | Uses <strong>predictions from different models</strong> — may or may not use bootstrap samples. |
| <strong>Purpose</strong> | To <strong>reduce variance</strong> and <strong>prevent overfitting</strong> in high-variance models like decision trees. | To <strong>combine predictions</strong> for improved overall accuracy and stability. |
| <strong>Example</strong> | Random Forest uses bagging to train many decision trees on different bootstrap samples. | The final voting or averaging step that combines all model outputs is aggregation. |</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ <strong>In short:</strong><br>
Bagging is the <strong>method of training models</strong> on bootstrap samples, while aggregation is the <strong>step of combining their predictions</strong> to form the final result.</p>
