<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
- <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans.<br>
- <strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> ML is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.  </p>

<h3 id="difference-between-ai-and-ml"><strong>Difference Between AI and ML</strong></h3>
<p>| <strong>Basis</strong> | <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> | <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| <strong>Meaning</strong> | AI is a broad concept that aims to make machines smart and capable of performing human-like tasks. | ML is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data. |
| <strong>Objective</strong> | To enable machines to simulate human intelligence and behavior. | To enable machines to learn from data and make predictions. |
| <strong>Scope</strong> | AI includes ML, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Expert Systems. | ML is a part of AI focused mainly on learning and prediction. |
| <strong>Data Dependency</strong> | AI can use rules, logic, and data. | ML is completely data-driven — it learns patterns from data. |
| <strong>Learning Ability</strong> | AI can reason, plan, and make decisions like humans. | ML learns automatically from past data and experience. |
| <strong>Human Intervention</strong> | AI may need human guidance for setting goals and interpreting results. | ML requires less human input once trained on data. |
| <strong>Output</strong> | Produces intelligent actions and decisions. | Produces predictions or classifications based on patterns. |
| <strong>Examples</strong> | Chatbots, Self-driving cars, Expert systems, Speech recognition. | Email spam filters, Recommendation systems, Price prediction. |</p>

<p>✅ <strong>In short:</strong><br>
- <strong>AI</strong> → The broader concept of making machines intelligent.<br>
- <strong>ML</strong> → A part of AI that helps systems learn automatically from data.<br>
Every ML system is AI, but not every AI system uses ML.</p>
