    <h2 id="goals-of-machine-learning">Goals of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>The main goals of Machine Learning (ML) are to make computers learn automatically from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Automation of Decision Making</li>
</ol>
<p>ML aims to help systems make automatic and accurate decisions without human help by learning patterns from past data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prediction and Forecasting</li>
</ol>
<p>ML models can predict future outcomes such as sales, stock prices, or weather, based on historical data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pattern Recognition</li>
</ol>
<p>ML identifies hidden patterns and relationships in large and complex datasets that humans may miss.</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous Improvement</li>
</ol>
<p>ML algorithms keep improving their accuracy and performance as they are exposed to more data over time.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
The goal of ML is to create systems that learn from experience, make predictions, and improve automatically without explicit programming.</p>
