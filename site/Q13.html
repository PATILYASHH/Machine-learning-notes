<p>A learning system in Machine Learning is a system that can learn from data, make predictions, and improve automatically.
Designing such a system involves several well-defined steps.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Problem Definition</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly define what problem you want to solve using ML.</p>
<p>Identify whether it’s classification, regression, or clustering.</p>
<p>Example: Predicting house prices, recognizing spam emails, etc.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Data Collection</li>
</ol>
<p>Collect relevant and sufficient data from different sources like databases, sensors, or online platforms.</p>
<p>The quality of the data directly affects the performance of the model.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Data Preprocessing</li>
</ol>
<p>Clean and prepare the data before using it.</p>
<p>Handle missing values, duplicates, and noise.</p>
<p>Perform feature scaling and normalization to make data suitable for ML models.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Data Splitting</li>
</ol>
<p>Divide the data into training and testing sets.</p>
<p>The training set is used to teach the model, and the testing set is used to check how well it performs.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Selection</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose the right Machine Learning algorithm based on the problem type and data nature.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Linear Regression → for continuous values</p>
<p>Decision Tree → for classification</p>
<p>K-Means → for clustering</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Training</li>
</ol>
<p>Feed the training data to the selected model.</p>
<p>The model learns patterns and relationships from the data during this phase.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>Test the model using the testing dataset.</p>
<p>Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Deployment and Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<p>Deploy the model into the real-world environment where it can make live predictions.</p>
<p>Continuously monitor and retrain the model with new data to keep it accurate and up to date.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
The 8 steps to design a learning system are —
Problem Definition → Data Collection → Data Preprocessing → Data Splitting → Model Selection → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Model Deployment.</p>
<p>These steps ensure the system learns effectively, performs accurately, and stays reliable in real-world use.</p>
