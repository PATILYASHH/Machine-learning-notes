<p>Definition:
Bias and Variance are two types of errors in Machine Learning that affect a model’s accuracy and performance.
They are part of the Bias-Variance Tradeoff, which helps in finding the right balance between underfitting and overfitting.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Bias:</li>
</ol>
<p>Bias means the error due to wrong assumptions made by the model.</p>
<p>A high bias model is too simple and ignores important data patterns.</p>
<p>It leads to underfitting — the model performs poorly on both training and testing data.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Using a straight line (Linear Regression) to fit data that actually forms a curve.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Variance:</li>
</ol>
<p>Variance means the error due to too much sensitivity to small changes in the training data.</p>
<p>A high variance model learns noise and unnecessary details.</p>
<p>It leads to overfitting — the model performs well on training data but poorly on testing data.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A complex decision tree that fits every data point perfectly but fails on new data.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:</p>
<p>High Bias → Underfitting → Model too simple.</p>
<p>High Variance → Overfitting → Model too complex.
A good ML model keeps a balance between bias and variance for best accuracy.</p>
