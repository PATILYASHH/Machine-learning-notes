    <p>Development Steps in Machine Learning (7 Steps) </p>
<p>Definition:
The development of a Machine Learning (ML) model involves several steps that guide how data is collected, prepared, trained, and used to make predictions. These steps ensure the model is accurate and reliable.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Problem Definition</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to clearly define the problem you want to solve.
Example: predicting student performance, detecting spam emails, or forecasting sales.
This step helps decide what kind of model and data are needed.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Data Collection</li>
</ol>
<p>Gather relevant and quality data from different sources such as databases, sensors, or files.
The more accurate and complete the data, the better the model’s performance.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Data Preprocessing</li>
</ol>
<p>Raw data often contains missing values, errors, or duplicates.
In this step, the data is cleaned, normalized, and made ready for analysis.
This step improves the accuracy and speed of the model.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Feature Selection and Engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify the most important input variables (features) that affect the output.
New useful features may also be created from existing data to improve prediction accuracy.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Selection and Training</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose the right algorithm (like Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Neural Network) and train it using the training dataset.
During training, the model learns patterns and relationships in the data.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Model Evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>Test the model’s performance using unseen (test) data.
Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE are used to check how well it performs.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Deployment and Monitoring</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the model performs well, it is deployed for real-world use.
Its performance is continuously monitored, and it may be retrained when new data becomes available.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
The 7 steps of machine learning development are —</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Problem Definition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Collection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Preprocessing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature Selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model Training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model Evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment and Monitoring</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps ensure that the ML model is accurate, efficient, and useful for real-world applications.</p>
