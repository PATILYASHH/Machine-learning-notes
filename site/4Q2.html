<p><em>Ans-</em></p>
<p>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the ‘K’ nearest data points in the dataset.</p>
<hr>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple and Easy to Understand:</li>
</ol>
<p>KNN is easy to implement and does not require complex training steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>No Training Phase:</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a lazy learner, meaning it stores data and makes predictions only when needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Works Well with Small Datasets:</li>
</ol>
<p>Performs well when the dataset is small and features are simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Versatile:</li>
</ol>
<p>Can be used for both classification and regression problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Slow for Large Datasets:</li>
</ol>
<p>It checks all data points during prediction, making it slow with big datasets.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sensitive to Noisy Data and Outliers:</li>
</ol>
<p>Incorrect or noisy data can reduce accuracy.</p>
<ol>
<li>High Memory Usage:</li>
</ol>
<p>Needs to store the entire dataset for predictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Feature Scaling Required:</li>
</ol>
<p>KNN depends on distance, so features must be normalized for good results.</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
KNN is simple and effective for small datasets, but it becomes slow and less accurate with large or noisy data.</p>
