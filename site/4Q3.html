<p>Definition:
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance automatically without being explicitly programmed.
It uses algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.</p>
<hr>
<p>Features of Machine Learning:</p>
<p>Feature Explanation</p>
<ol>
<li>Data-Driven: ML systems learn from past data and experience to make accurate predictions.</li>
<li>Self-Learning:   Models automatically improve their accuracy over time as more data is provided.</li>
<li>Automation:  Reduces human intervention by automating decision-making processes.</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement:  The model updates and refines itself as new data comes in, improving performance.</li>
<li>Wide Applications:   Used in fields like healthcare, finance, marketing, and recommendation systems.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
Machine Learning helps systems learn, adapt, and make intelligent decisions automatically using data, making it powerful for solving real-world problems</p>
