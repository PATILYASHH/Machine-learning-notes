### **What is Probability? What are the Rules of Probability? – 8 Marks**

---

### **1. Definition of Probability**

**Probability** is a branch of mathematics that measures the **likelihood or chance** of an event happening.  
It tells us **how likely** it is that a certain outcome will occur.

\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

Where:  
- **P(E)** = Probability of event E  
- \( 0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 \)

---

### **2. Example**

If a coin is tossed once:  
- Total outcomes = {Head, Tail} → 2 outcomes  
- Probability of getting Head = 1/2 = 0.5  
- Probability of getting Tail = 1/2 = 0.5  

So, **each outcome has equal chance** of occurring.

### **3. Types of Probability**

1. **Theoretical Probability:** Based on reasoning (e.g., coin toss).  
2. **Experimental Probability:** Based on actual experiments or data.  
3. **Subjective Probability:** Based on personal judgment or belief.

---

### **4. Rules of Probability**

#### **Rule 1: Non-Negative Rule**
The probability of any event is **always between 0 and 1**.

\[
0 \leq P(E) \leq 1
\]

- **0** means the event is **impossible**.  
- **1** means the event is **certain**.

---

#### **Rule 2: Sum Rule (or Addition Rule)**
For two **mutually exclusive events** A and B:

\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
\]

If events are **not mutually exclusive**, then:

\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

---

#### **Rule 3: Complementary Rule**
The probability that an event **does not occur** is:

\[
P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(A)
\]

**Example:**  
If the chance of rain today is 0.3, then the chance of no rain = 1 - 0.3 = **0.7**.

---

#### **Rule 4: Multiplication Rule**
For **independent events** A and B:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]

**Example:**  
If P(A) = 1/2 and P(B) = 1/3,  
then \( P(A \cap B) = 1/2 \times 1/3 = 1/6 \).

---

#### **Rule 5: Conditional Probability**
The probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred is:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

---

### **5. Summary Table**

| **Rule Name** | **Formula** | **Meaning** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Non-Negative Rule | \(0 \leq P(E) \leq 1\) | Probability is always between 0 and 1 |
| Addition Rule | \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\) | For union of events |
| Complementary Rule | \(P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(A)\) | Probability of event not happening |
| Multiplication Rule | \(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)\) | For independent events |
| Conditional Probability | \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\) | Probability of A given B |

---

✅ **In short:**  
Probability measures how likely an event is to happen.  
The **rules of probability** help calculate chances for single, combined, and dependent events — forming the base for **Machine Learning and statistical models**.
