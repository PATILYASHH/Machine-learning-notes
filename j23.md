### Q. Write short note on Method Overriding. (4 Marks)

Method overriding in Java occurs when a **subclass provides its own implementation** of a method already defined in its parent class.  
It is used to achieve **runtime polymorphism** and to modify inherited behavior.

**Key Points:**
- Same method name, same parameters, same return type.
- Must be in **parent-child (inheritance)** relationship.
- Decided at **runtime** (Dynamic Binding).
- `@Override` annotation is used (optional but recommended).

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog(); 
        a.sound(); 
    }
}

Output:

Dog barks

Method overriding allows subclasses to customize the behavior of methods inherited from the parent class.
