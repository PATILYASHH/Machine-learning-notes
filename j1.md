Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent** programming language that supports **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** using bytecode and JVM. It is secure, portable, and robust, making it suitable for modern software development.

**Features of Java:**
- **Simple:** Clean syntax, easy to learn, no pointers.
- **Object-Oriented:** Uses classes and objects with OOP principles.
- **Platform-Independent:** Runs on any OS via JVM.
- **Secure:** No direct memory access, bytecode verification, sandboxing.
- **Robust:** Automatic garbage collection, exception handling.
- **Multithreaded:** Supports multiple threads for parallel execution.
- **Portable:** Fixed data types and platform-independent bytecode.
- **High Performance:** JIT compiler for faster execution.
