### Write a Note on Bootstrap Sampling (4 Marks)

**Definition:**  
Bootstrap Sampling is a **statistical method** used in Machine Learning to **estimate the accuracy and stability** of a model.  
It involves **randomly selecting samples from a dataset with replacement**, meaning the same data point can appear more than once in a sample.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Sampling with Replacement:**  
   - Each time a data point is chosen, it is **put back into the dataset** before the next selection.  
   - This allows some data points to appear multiple times in one sample.

2. **Purpose:**  
   - To estimate **model performance** when the available dataset is small.  
   - To create multiple **training datasets** for techniques like **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**.

3. **Use in Ensemble Methods:**  
   - Bootstrap Sampling is the **foundation of Bagging**, used in models like **Random Forest**.

4. **Advantage:**  
   - Helps in **reducing overfitting** and **improving model stability** by training on varied samples.

### **Example:**
If we have a dataset `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`,  
a bootstrap sample could be `[2, 4, 4, 1, 5]` — notice that some elements repeat because of replacement.

✅ **In short:**  
Bootstrap Sampling is a **resampling technique** that helps **estimate accuracy and variability** by training models on multiple random subsets of data.
