The **Java API (Application Programming Interface)** is a collection of **pre-defined classes, interfaces, and packages** provided by Java to help developers perform common tasks without writing code from scratch. It provides built-in libraries for input/output, collections, networking, database access, and GUI programming.

Some important Java API packages are:
- `java.lang` – Core classes (String, Math, System)
- `java.util` – Collections, Scanner, Date classes
- `java.io` – File and input/output operations
- `java.net` – Networking classes
- `java.awt` / `javax.swing` – GUI components

**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    }
}

The Java API improves code reuse, productivity, and development speed by offering ready-made components.
