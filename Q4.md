### Difference Between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans.  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** ML is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

### **Difference Between AI and ML**

| **Basis** | **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | **Machine Learning (ML)** |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Meaning** | AI is a broad concept that aims to make machines smart and capable of performing human-like tasks. | ML is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data. |
| **Objective** | To enable machines to simulate human intelligence and behavior. | To enable machines to learn from data and make predictions. |
| **Scope** | AI includes ML, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Expert Systems. | ML is a part of AI focused mainly on learning and prediction. |
| **Data Dependency** | AI can use rules, logic, and data. | ML is completely data-driven — it learns patterns from data. |
| **Learning Ability** | AI can reason, plan, and make decisions like humans. | ML learns automatically from past data and experience. |
| **Human Intervention** | AI may need human guidance for setting goals and interpreting results. | ML requires less human input once trained on data. |
| **Output** | Produces intelligent actions and decisions. | Produces predictions or classifications based on patterns. |
| **Examples** | Chatbots, Self-driving cars, Expert systems, Speech recognition. | Email spam filters, Recommendation systems, Price prediction. |

✅ **In short:**  
- **AI** → The broader concept of making machines intelligent.  
- **ML** → A part of AI that helps systems learn automatically from data.  
Every ML system is AI, but not every AI system uses ML.
