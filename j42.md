### Q. Define Exception. Explain try, catch and finally block with example. (8 Marks)

An **exception** in Java is an unwanted event that occurs during program execution and disrupts the normal flow of the program.  
It may occur due to invalid input, division by zero, file missing, etc. Java uses **exception handling** to manage such errors gracefully.

---

### ✅ try block
- Contains code that might throw an exception.
- When an exception occurs, control jumps to the `catch` block.

### ✅ catch block
- Handles the exception thrown from the `try` block.
- Different catch blocks can handle different exceptions.

### ✅ finally block
- Always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.
- Used to release resources like files, database connection, etc.

### ✅ Example

```java
class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int a = 10 / 0;    // risky code (throws exception)
            System.out.println(a);
        } 
        catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        } 
        finally {
            System.out.println("Execution completed.");
        }
    }
}

✅ Output

Cannot divide by zero!
Execution completed.

The try-catch-finally mechanism ensures error handling, program stability, and proper resource management even when exceptions occur.
