### **Bayes’ Theorem – Statement, Proof, and Example (8 Marks)**

---

### **1. Definition**

**Bayes’ Theorem** is a fundamental concept in probability and Machine Learning that helps us **update the probability of a hypothesis** based on new evidence.  
It is used to find **conditional probability** — the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred.

---

### **2. Statement of Bayes’ Theorem**

If **A** and **B** are two events, and **P(B) ≠ 0**, then Bayes’ theorem is stated as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

---

### **3. Meaning of Terms**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| **P(A)** | Prior probability of event A (before seeing evidence) |
| **P(B|A)** | Likelihood — probability of observing B given A is true |
| **P(B)** | Total probability of event B (evidence) |
| **P(A|B)** | Posterior probability — probability of A given that B has occurred |

---

### **4. Proof of Bayes’ Theorem**

From the **definition of conditional probability**:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad ...(1)
\]

and

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \quad ...(2)
\]

From equation (2),  
\[
P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)
\]

Substitute this value into equation (1):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Hence, **proved** ✅

### **5. Example**

A company manufactures bulbs in **two factories**, **F1** and **F2**.

- **F1** produces **60%** of total bulbs.  
- **F2** produces **40%** of total bulbs.  
- **1%** of bulbs from **F1** are defective.  
- **2%** of bulbs from **F2** are defective.

Now, if a **randomly selected bulb is defective**, find the probability that it was produced by **Factory F1**.

---

### **Solution**

Let:  
- A₁ = Bulb from F1  
- A₂ = Bulb from F2  
- B = Bulb is defective  

Given:  
\[
P(A₁) = 0.6, \quad P(A₂) = 0.4
\]  
\[
P(B|A₁) = 0.01, \quad P(B|A₂) = 0.02
\]

We need to find **P(A₁|B)**.

---

#### Step 1: Find P(B)
\[
P(B) = P(B|A₁)P(A₁) + P(B|A₂)P(A₂)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.01)(0.6) + (0.02)(0.4) = 0.006 + 0.008 = 0.014
\]

#### Step 2: Apply Bayes’ Theorem
\[
P(A₁|B) = \frac{P(B|A₁) \times P(A₁)}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A₁|B) = \frac{(0.01)(0.6)}{0.014} = \frac{0.006}{0.014} = 0.4286
\]

---

### **6. Final Answer**
The probability that the **defective bulb** came from **Factory F1** is approximately **0.4286 (42.86%)**.

✅ **In short:**  
Bayes’ Theorem helps **update probabilities** based on **new evidence** and is widely used in **spam filtering, medical diagnosis, and classification algorithms**.
