### Difference Between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is a broad field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** ML is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn automatically from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

### **7 Key Differences Between AI and ML**

| **No.** | **Basis** | **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | **Machine Learning (ML)** |
|:--:|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **1** | **Meaning** | AI is a technology that enables machines to think, act, and make decisions like humans. | ML is a technique that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions. |
| **2** | **Goal** | The main goal of AI is to develop intelligent systems that can simulate human behavior. | The main goal of ML is to enable machines to learn automatically from past data. |
| **3** | **Scope** | AI is a wider concept that includes ML, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Natural Language Processing. | ML is a narrow concept and a part of AI. |
| **4** | **Approach** | AI focuses on building a system that can reason, plan, and make decisions. | ML focuses on finding patterns and relationships in data. |
| **5** | **Data Dependency** | AI can use both data and logic-based rules to perform tasks. | ML completely depends on data for learning and predictions. |
| **6** | **Human Intervention** | AI may still require human guidance for defining goals and constraints. | ML needs less human involvement once trained on data. |
| **7** | **Output** | Produces intelligent behavior and decision-making abilities. | Produces data-driven predictions or classifications. |

✅ **In short:**  
- **AI** is the **bigger concept** — making machines act and think smartly.  
- **ML** is a **subset of AI** — focused on making machines **learn from data automatically**.  
So, every ML system is part of AI, but not all AI systems rely on ML.
