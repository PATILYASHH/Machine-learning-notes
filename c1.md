## What is Software Engineering?

Software Engineering is the systematic, disciplined, and measurable approach to developing, operating, and maintaining software. It applies engineering principles to produce reliable, efficient, and high-quality software that meets user requirements.

## Need for Software Engineering

1. **Growing Complexity**  
   Modern software systems are large and complex; unstructured coding cannot handle them.

2. **Quality Assurance**  
   Users demand reliability, security, and performance. SE ensures these through standards and processes.

3. **Cost and Time Control**  
   Proper planning, estimation, and scheduling prevent delays and budget overruns.

4. **Maintainability**  
   Software must be easy to update, fix, and scale over time. SE ensures long-term maintainability.

5. **Team Coordination**  
   Large projects require multiple developers. SE provides documentation, processes, and clear roles.

6. **Customer Satisfaction**  
   Ensures the final product matches user needs and expectations.

7. **Reduced Failure Rate**  
   Structured methods decrease project failures caused by poor planning or chaotic development.
