# Q. Advantages and Disadvantages of K-nearest neighbor algorithm 

*Ans-*

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the ‘K’ nearest data points in the dataset.

Advantages:

1. Simple and Easy to Understand:

KNN is easy to implement and does not require complex training steps.



2. No Training Phase:

It is a lazy learner, meaning it stores data and makes predictions only when needed.



3. Works Well with Small Datasets:

Performs well when the dataset is small and features are simple.



4. Versatile:

Can be used for both classification and regression problems.





---

Disadvantages:

1. Slow for Large Datasets:

It checks all data points during prediction, making it slow with big datasets.



2. Sensitive to Noisy Data and Outliers:

Incorrect or noisy data can reduce accuracy.



3. High Memory Usage:

Needs to store the entire dataset for predictions.



4. Feature Scaling Required:

KNN depends on distance, so features must be normalized for good results.

✅ In short:
KNN is simple and effective for small datasets, but it becomes slow and less accurate with large or noisy data.
