*Ans-*


Advantages and Disadvantages of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm – 4 Marks

Advantages	Disadvantages

1. Simple and Easy to Understand: Easy to implement and interpret.	1. Slow for Large Datasets: Needs to compare with all data points during prediction.
2. No Training Phase: Works instantly without model training.	2. Sensitive to Noisy Data: Errors or outliers can affect results.
3. Works Well with Small Datasets: Performs well when data is limited and clean.	3. High Memory Usage: Must store all data for predictions.
4. Versatile: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.	4. Requires Feature Scaling: Distance-based, so normalization is necessary for accuracy.


✅ In short:
KNN is simple and effective for small datasets but slow and sensitive when data is large or noisy.
