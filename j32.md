### Q. Define inheritance. Explain hierarchical inheritance in Java with example. (8 Marks)

**Inheritance** in Java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.  
It supports **code reusability, method overriding, and better class structure** in OOPS.

The class that inherits is called **subclass (child class)** and the class being inherited from is called **superclass (parent class)**.

### ✅ Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance occurs when **multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class**.

Parent
   /     \

Child1   Child2

### ✅ Example of Hierarchical Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();
        d.bark();

        Cat c = new Cat();
        c.eat();
        c.meow();
    }
}

✅ Output

Eating...
Dog barks
Eating...
Cat meows

Hierarchical inheritance allows shared behavior in parent class and individual behaviors in child classes, improving code reuse and clarity.
