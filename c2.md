## What is Testing?

Testing is the process of evaluating software to find defects and ensure it meets the required specifications. Its goal is to detect errors, verify functionality, and ensure the software is reliable, secure, and performs as expected before release.

## Types of Testing

### 1. **Unit Testing**
Tests individual components or functions of the software to ensure each part works correctly.

### 2. **Integration Testing**
Checks how different modules or components work together after integration.

### 3. **System Testing**
Tests the complete and integrated system to verify it meets all requirements.

### 4. **Acceptance Testing**
Performed by the end user or client to ensure the software satisfies business requirements.

### 5. **Black Box Testing**
Focuses on input–output behavior without knowing internal code structure.

### 6. **White Box Testing**
Tests internal logic, code paths, and structure of the program.

### 7. **Regression Testing**
Ensures new changes or fixes do not break existing functionality.

### 8. **Performance Testing**
Checks speed, responsiveness, scalability, and stability under load.

### 9. **Alpha and Beta Testing**
- **Alpha:** Conducted by internal testers.  
- **Beta:** Conducted by real users before final release.
